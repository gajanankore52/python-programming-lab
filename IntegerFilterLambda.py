# Write a Python program to filter a list of integers using Lambda.

# Original list of integers:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Even numbers from the said list:
# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Odd numbers from the said list:
# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]


list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Even_number = list(filter(lambda x:x%2==0,list1))

print(Even_number)

Odd_number = list(filter(lambda x:x%2==1,list1))

print(Odd_number)
